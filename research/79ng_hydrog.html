  <p class="abstract">The mass loss at Nioghalvfjerdsbr<span>æ</span> is primarily due to rapid submarine melting. Ocean data obtained from beneath the Nioghalvfjerdsbr<span>æ</span> ice tongue show that melting is driven by the presence of warm (1<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C) Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW). A sill prevents AIW from entering the cavity from Dijmphna Sund, requiring that it flow into the cavity via bathymetric channels to the south at a pinned ice front. Comparison of water properties from the cavity, Dijmphna Sund, and the continental shelf support this conclusion. Overturning circulation rates inferred from observed melt rates and cavity stratification suggest an exchange flow between the cavity and the continental shelf of 38mSv, sufficient to flush cavity waters in under one year. These results place upper bounds on the timescales of external variability that can be transmitted to the glacier via the ice tongue cavity.</p>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) is a region of rapid ice flow that drains approximately half of the northern sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet <span class="citation">[<em>Fahnestock et al.</em>, 2001; <em>Rignot and Kanagaratnam</em>, 2006]</span>. Much of the topographical trough NEGIS flows within is below sea level and deepens toward the continental interior <span class="citation">[<em>Bamber et al.</em>, 2013]</span>, suggesting that it could be susceptible to marine ice sheet instability <span class="citation">[<em>Weertman</em>, 1974]</span>. The buttressing effect of ice tongues at outlet glaciers provides a stabilizing influence on marine ice sheets <span class="citation">[<em>Dupont and Alley</em>, 2005]</span>. The inferred presence of the ice tongue Nioghalvfjerdsbr<span>æ</span> (79NG) at the terminus of NEGIS over the past 4ka <span class="citation">[<em>Reeh et al.</em>, 2001]</span> suggests it to be stable, although it has advanced and retreated many tens of kilometers since the early Holocene <span class="citation">[<em>Reeh et al.</em>, 2001; <em>Evans et al.</em>, 2009]</span>. In contrast, neighbouring Zachari<span>æ</span> Isstr<span>ø</span>m (ZI), the second marine outlet of NEGIS, has experienced collapse and rapid retreat since 2002 <span class="citation">[<em>Rignot and Kanagaratnam</em>, 2006; <em>Khan et al.</em>, 2014]</span> indicating that the region may be undergoing change. Because of the large area drained by NEGIS and the potential for large sea level rise if it should become unstable in the future, it is important to assess the likelihood of future retreat.</p>
  <p>79NG terminates with a 70km long and 20km wide ice tongue that floats in Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden and has a grounding depth of 600m <span class="citation">[<em>Mayer et al.</em>, 2000]</span>. 79NG is noteworthy in that the majority of mass-loss is driven by melting at the ice-ocean interface at the base of the ice tongue, rather than by calving <span class="citation">[<em>Reeh et al.</em>, 1999]</span>. The most rapid melting occurs in the vicinity of the grounding zone <span class="citation">[<em>Seroussi et al.</em>, 2011]</span>, where the ice tongue is thickest and exposed to deeper and warmer waters. Increases in submarine melt rates could lead to thinning, resulting in a reduction in buttressing capacity and loss of ice shelf strength. A similar sequence of events is believed to have driven the recent acceleration and retreat of Jakobshavn Isbr<span>æ</span> in western Greenland <span class="citation">[<em>Holland et al.</em>, 2008; <em>Motyka et al.</em>, 2011]</span>. The loss of buttressing provided by the former Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica also led to outlet glacier acceleration <span class="citation">[<em>Rignot et al.</em>, 2004; <em>Scambos et al.</em>, 2004]</span>. To assess the stability of 79NG and NEGIS to changes in ocean forcing, we first need to understand the present state of ice-ocean interactions. This includes identifying the circulating watermasses, the pathways through which they enter the cavity, and the processes that govern their variability.</p>
  <p>79NG abuts Hovgaard <span>Ø</span>, which divides the ice tongue into two sections (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>). As a result, two potential pathways for water flow into the 79NG cavity exist. One, bypassing Hovgaard <span>Ø</span> to the north through the 80km long Dijmphna Sund, provides access to a northern terminus from Westwind Trough on the continental shelf. Alternatively, water may flow beneath a bathymetrically-pinned ice front south of Hovgaard <span>Ø</span> that potentially links the cavity to warm waters that reside in Norske Trough to the south. On the shelf, shallow Polar Water (PW) circulates counterclockwise through Norske Trough and Westwind Trough around Belgica Bank <span class="citation">[<em>Johnson and Niebauer</em>, 1995; <em>Schneider and Budéus</em>, 1995; <em>Topp and Johnson</em>, 1997]</span>. Circulation of deeper and warmer Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) is less clearly defined. Previous surveys have found the warmest waters to be confined to Belgica Trough and Norske Trough and apparently distinct from the AIW found in Westwind Trough <span class="citation">[<em>Budéus et al.</em>, 1997]</span>. <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span> propose that AIW originating in Westwind Trough enters the cavity by flowing through Dijmphna Sund. In this scenario, Westwind Trough is the primary source of AIW interacting with the glacier.</p>
  <p>We present data collected in 2009 that indicates that the main pathway for AIW into the cavity is beneath the pinned ice front instead. The significance of this result is that cavity exchange with warmer water masses in Norske Trough is possible. This constitutes a more direct route, and one that is likely strongly influenced by the distribution of sea ice near the pinned front and by mixing processes within bathymetric channels beneath the pinned front. Our measurements also indicate that some of the relatively fresh glacially-modified water is exported to the continental shelf via Dijmphna Sund. Finally, we use water properties measured from the 79NG cavity in combination with a simple model of an overturning circulation to show that the renewal of water within the cavity occurs on timescales of less than one year, requiring a fairly vigorous exchange between the continental shelf and the cavity.</p>
  <h2 id="data">Data</h2>
  <p>In September 2009, salinity, temperature, and depth (CTD) surveys in Dijmphna Sund and west of Belgica Bank were conducted from the icebreaker MV Arctic Sunrise over the course of four days with an RBR XR-620 profiler (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>). Thick landfast ice limited the spatial extent of sampling. Bathymetry was collected along the ship track using a single beam depth sounder.</p>
  <p>On the continental shelf, we surveyed two east-west sections that we refer to as Westwind Trough (north) and Norske Trough (south) after the two deep bathymetric troughs nearby (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>). We also measured properties along a section through Dijmphna Sund, including cross-fjord sections at the fjord mouth and near the glacier terminus. Sea ice prevented the collection of profiles near the pinned terminus. Two additional CTD profiles, 5km apart, were collected via helicopter in a rift in the floating ice tongue, 15km up-glacier from the northern terminus. These profiles provide a snapshot of properties within 79NG’s cavity. In addition to the CTD profiles described above, a number of Sippican T-5, T-6, and T-7 expendable bathythermograph (XBT) profiles were collected by helicopter survey from the rift, northern terminus, and pinned ice front (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>).</p>
  <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
  <h3 id="shelf-properties">Shelf properties</h3>
  <p>Regionally, we observe relatively warm AIW (<span class="math inline">\(\theta &gt;\)</span>0<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C; S<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>34.3) at depth, while colder and fresher PW occupies the upper 100–150m (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>), in agreement with prior surveys <span class="citation">[e.g. <em>Bourke et al.</em>, 1987; <em>Budéus and Schneider</em>, 1995]</span>. The warmest waters were observed in Norske Trough immediately east of Hovgaard <span>Ø</span>. We find these waters to be distinct from the warmest waters in Westwind Trough to the north. As indicated by the large contrast in temperature (0.6<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C) and salinity (0.13) (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>), as well as the overlap in temperature-salinity space (<a href="#fig:ts">Fig.</a>), a barrier may separate the two troughs, preventing the warmer and denser Norske Trough water from moving northward. Sea ice cover prevented us from mapping the bathymetry in this region. The lower temperatures in Westwind Trough relative to Norske Trough match similar observations reported by <span class="citation"><em>Budéus and Schneider</em> [1995]</span>. In measurements described by <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span>, a warm layer is reported near the pinned front, similar to our findings in Norske Trough.</p>
  <h3 id="inflow-pathways">Inflow pathways</h3>
  <p>At the mouth of Dijmphna Sund, we mapped a shallow sill blocking inflow of AIW from the continental shelf (<a href="#fig:sill">Fig.</a>). This sill has been followed across the channel, and has a maximum depth of <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span>170m. That the sill is an obstacle to the flow of AIW from the continental shelf to the cavity is confirmed by a large salinity contrast (0.1) observed between Dijmphna Sund and the deep waters below 180m on the continental shelf (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>). These findings suggest that the deep (greater than 200m) waters in Dijmphna Sund are not primarily due to flow over the sill, contradicting the conclusions by <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span>. We turn to the alternative possibility, that AIW primarily flows to the glacier beneath the pinned front, filling Dijmphna Sund from near the glacier terminus.</p>
  <p>Sub-ice shelf properties sampled from the glacial rift southwest of Dijmphna Sund broadly mimic those on the continental shelf, insomuch as deeper water is warmer and saltier. The deepest waters bear closest resemblance to those in Norske Trough (<a href="#fig:ts">Fig.</a>). Maximum temperatures from the rift exceed maximum water temperatures in Westwind Trough (by 0.2<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C) and Dijmphna Sund (by 0.25<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C) (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>). This finding further supports our conclusion that the AIW flowing into the glacier cavity originates from Norske Trough and flows into the cavity under the pinned front. Soundings collected by <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span> show a seabed topography near the glacier front exceeding 300m depth, allowing such a pathway. Finally, the differences in properties between the cavity and Dijmphna Sund below 350m suggests that there could be an additional sill separating the cavity under the ice from the deep Dijmphna Sund basin (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>).</p>
  <h3 id="glacial-modification-and-export-pathways">Glacial modification and export pathways</h3>
  <p>By analyzing the temperature and salinity of different water masses <span class="citation">[e.g. <em>Straneo et al.</em>, 2012]</span>, we infer the presence in the cavity of both glacial meltwater-modified water (MMW) and glacial runoff-modified water (RMW), formed by mixing between ambient ocean water and meltwater formed upstream of the grounding zone, such as surface melt. MMW is identified on the basis of T-S anomalies along the meltwater line (<a href="#fig:ts">Fig.</a>) relative to the trend observed on the continental shelf. On the other hand, RMW water is fresher than the water from which it derives, and therefore plots to the left of the continental shelf watermasses in T-S space.</p>
  <p>We observe MMW above <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>360m depth, while RMW exists above <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>300m depth. The MMW signature is clearest in when collapsed onto a temperature versus depth plot (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>), where water above 360m is 0.2–0.3<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C colder than water below. Because the temperature shift is apparent in many deep CTD and XBT profiles from the rift and northern terminus, we believe that the hypothesized MMW-modified layer is widely-distributed in space. A thick (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>300m) layer of MMW-modified water has been described at Petermann Fjord in northwestern Greenland by <span class="citation"><em>Johnson et al.</em> [2011]</span>, and our data is consistent with a similarly-modified layer here. The glacial runoff signature manifests as an offset in T-S space near the 27.6kgm<span class="math inline">\(^{-3}\)</span> isopycnal (<a href="#fig:ts">Fig.</a>). Water in the rift at this depth is fresher than the water below without a corresponding temperature change characteristic of MMW. It would be possible to form a similar water mass by modification of dense Norske Trough water not observed in the cavity, however the absence of any intermediate water masses resulting from mixing suggests instead that the relatively fresh water derives from injection of runoff into the cavity.</p>
  <p>At the head of Dijmphna Sund, water is fresher than found on the continental shelf (see Dijmphna Sund data in <a href="#fig:ts">Figure</a>). The salinity anomaly weakens toward the sill consistent with mixing with shelf water. The low salinity indicates mixing with freshwater, while the along fjord gradient suggests that the source is RMW and that the northern terminus is one pathway by which modified water leaves the cavity. At the same time, the upper PW layer is warmer near the glacier than near the sill (<a href="#fig:sections">Fig.</a>). A similar pattern has been observed by <span class="citation"><em>Straneo et al.</em> [2012]</span> in other Greenland fjord systems characterized by increasing temperature with depth, and diagnosed as upwelling of warmer and deeper water freshened through glacial modification. At the mouth of Dijmphna Sund, a geostrophically-inferred flow implies laterally-varying exchange (<a href="#fig:sill">Fig.</a>). A plume from the Dijmphna Sund mouth may contribute to a low salinity anomaly on the continental shelf east of Hovgaard <span>Ø</span> at depths shallower than 100m.</p>
  <h3 id="cavity-circulation">Cavity circulation</h3>
  <p>Within the cavity, the vertical distribution of unmodified and glacially-modified water types suggests that warm AIW enters at depth, driving melting and mixing with glacial runoff. The less dense modified waters formed by mixing during this interaction rise and spread beneath the ice tongue (<a href="#fig:schematic">Fig.</a>). The net circulation therefore involves a net inflow at depth and a net outflow of MMW and RMW within the upper portion of the water column, similar to the net circulation expected to take place in other glacial fjords <span class="citation">[e.g. <em>Motyka et al.</em>, 2003; <em>Johnson et al.</em>, 2011; <em>Sutherland et al.</em>, 2014]</span>.</p>
  <p>Previous researchers have applied various salt balance techniques to estimate rates of estuarine overturning in glacial fjords <span class="citation">[e.g. <em>Straneo et al.</em>, 2010; <em>Sutherland et al.</em>, 2014]</span>. Such approaches are limited in particular by the uncertain freshwater input into the fjord from melting and runoff. Instead, we employ a thermal analogue to the Knudsen conservation relation for estuarine circulation to place bounds on the net exchange flow. In common with previous methods we assume a two-layer exchange driven by freshening due to glacial inputs, however our approach only requires knowledge of the submarine melt rate. For glaciers with floating ice, the submarine melt rate can be estimated via ice flux divergence methods <span class="citation">[e.g <em>Seroussi et al.</em>, 2011]</span>. We neglect temporal variability, which is discussed further below.</p>
  <p>The cavity heat budget is simplified due to the fact that it is completely enclosed by the ice tongue and fjord bathymetry everywhere except at the mouth. Given that the heat budget within the cavity is controlled by water advection at the mouth and latent heat costs for melting ice, the simple relation holds</p>
  <p><span class="math display">\[Q_\text{e} = \frac{L_f}{c_w}
          \left( \frac{Q_\text{m}}{T_\text{in} - T_\text{out}} \right),
      \label{eq:thermal_knudsen}\]</span></p>
  <p>where <span class="math inline">\(Q_\text{e}\)</span> is the overturning exchange flow implied at the cavity mouth, <span class="math inline">\(Q_\text{m}\)</span> is the flux of meltwater, <span class="math inline">\(L_f\)</span> is the latent heat of fusion, <span class="math inline">\(c_w\)</span> is the specific heat for water, and <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{out}\)</span> are the potential temperatures of incoming and outgoing water, respectively. This relation neglects vertically-averaged flow terms at the mouth as well as the effect of glacial runoff entering the cavity, both of which are small.</p>
  <p><span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span> report annual melt volumes of <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>11.2km<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>yr<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> based on flux divergence, requiring <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>3.7<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>10<span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>Jyr<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> of heat input. Assuming that the inflowing water is the deepest because it is denser prior to glacial modification, we estimate <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{in}\approx 1^\circ\)</span>C (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>). Our measurements indicate that possible values for the glacially-modified outgoing water are in the range <span class="math inline">\(-0.2^\circ\text{C} \le
  T_\text{out} \le 0.6^\circ\text{C}\)</span>. The resulting exchange flows, using the published melt rate estimate, are shown in <a href="#fig:circulation">Figure</a>. Selecting an outgoing water temperature of 0.2<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C, which is roughly in the middle of the range of modified waters in the cavity (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>), the exchange flow at the cavity mouth is 38mSv, compared to 0.36mSv of meltwater flux. Given a mean water column thickness of 500m and cavity dimensions of 70km by 20km, the estuarine timescale is <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>215days. This timescale is a maximum estimate of a cavity exchange timescale, as other processes may also contribute to exchange <span class="citation">[e.g. <em>Straneo et al.</em>, 2010]</span>. Over the range of plausible values for outgoing temperature suggested above, the estuarine timescale ranges from 110–320days.</p>
  <p>Temporal variability in the incoming water temperature is unknown, and our ability to estimate the overturning flow depends on the relative timescales of external variability and fjord renewal. The estimate above is based on an assumption that the temperature stratification observed is the cavity is representative of values over longer periods. Also, the inferred melt rates represent time-averaged values that may not be representative of current water temperatures and properties.</p>
  <h2 id="discussion-and-summary">Discussion and Summary</h2>
  <p>Observed bathymetry and water properties show that AIW does not primarily enter the 79NG cavity from Dijmphna Sund, as hypothesized by <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span>. This statement is supported by two lines of evidence. On the continental shelf, AIW with temperature greater than 1<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C occurs in our data only at 230–270m (<a href="#fig:profiles">Fig.</a>), well below the depth of the sill in Dijmphna Sund. Secondly, maximum temperatures in the cavity are greater than temperatures observed in Dijmphna Sund, further indicating that AIW beneath the ice tongue does not transit through Dijmphna Sund. The nature of the survey does not permit us to put the observed spatial variability into the context of temporal variability. However, the salinity contrast below 170m depth observed on either side of the sill confirms that the sill is an effective barrier to the exchange of deeper waters. In addition, density calculated in the rift below 350m is higher than that in Dijmphna Sund. This suggests that there could be a second sill separating Dijmphna Sund from the rift. Measurements taken from Dijmphna Sund are therefore unlikely to be representative of the 79NG cavity, and it appears that the deepest waters in Dijmphna Sund are isolated from both Westwind Trough and the cavity. The remaining alternative pathway for AIW is renewal via the pinned ice front. <span class="citation"><em>Mayer et al.</em> [2000]</span> describe bathymetric data that support the existence of deep (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>400m) channels beneath the pinned front. Inflow of AIW into the cavity is therefore likely to occur through such deep channels. Given the limited nature of the survey, it was impossible to assess the extent to which seasonal or higher frequency fluctuations in the PW-AIW interface depth might affect the exchange between the continental shelf and the ice shelf cavity. A better understanding of temporal variability in the front between PW and AIW on the continental shelf is important for characterizing the potential for warmer water to enter the cavity in past and future climates.</p>
  <p>The conclusion that the transport of warm water to the 79NG cavity does not directly involve Dijmphna Sund has implications for the effect on the glacier of variability on the continental shelf. The pinned terminus also appears to provide a shorter pathway between the shelf and the cavity, exposing the cavity more directly to the impact of shelf-driven processes such as intermediary flows <span class="citation">[e.g <em>Jackson et al.</em>, 2014]</span>. The near perennial, extensive sea-ice barrier just beyond the terminus could also have an impact on the access of AIW to the cavity. If the recent initiation of quasi-seasonal disintegration of the Norske <span>Ø</span>er Ice Barrier <span class="citation">[<em>Hughes et al.</em>, 2011]</span> changes the dynamics of local currents and the Northeast Water Polynya, then the supply of warm water into the glacier cavity could be altered.</p>
  <p>Melting beneath 79NG results in formation of MMW, which mixes with ambient AIW to form glacially-modified water observed in the cavity and Dijmphna Sund. Also present is a signature from mixing with glacial runoff. The resulting glacially modified waters are less dense than the ambient water, resulting in a shallow layer of anomalously warm water and an overturning exchange circulation that drives heat flow into the cavity and is driven by glacial melting.</p>
  <p>Based on an idealized model of an overturning circulation with heat conservation, we estimate the exchange between the cavity and the continental shelf associated with melting to be <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>40mSv. An exchange flow of this magnitude implies timescales of water renewal of less than one year and underscores the highly coupled nature of ice-ocean interactions. This is relevant to both discussions of past and future ocean-forced variability at 79NG. Additional data is required to evaluate the role played by other, external mechanisms in cavity renewal. Further mapping of the channels and measurement of the daily to inter-annual variability in shelf and cavity processes are critical future steps in assessing the sensitivity of 79NG to ocean processes.</p>
