<p>I completed Master&#39;s degree research at the Simon Fraser University <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~gflowers/">Glaciology
Group</a> using sled-mounted radar to map and study
the internal temperatures of mountain glaciers in Yukon, Canada. We found the
temperature structure to be dominated by processes taking place in the
high-elevation accumulation areas of several glaciers, signals of which are
retained as the ice flows toward lower elevations. We explored this process
further by reproducing it in simple numerical models of glacier flow and heat
transfer.</p>
<p>Some of the software that I used during my research continues to be used in the
form of <a href="http://irlib.ironicmtn.com">irlib</a>, a Python package for reading and
processing radar files generated by <a href="http://www.radar.bluesystem.ca/">Blue System Integration ice-penetrating
radar</a>.</p>

<p>I then worked at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using
oceanographic measurements from northern Greenland to infer the circulation
within an ice-covered fjord. I built an automated process to use large
quantities of high-resolution optical satellite imagery to infer melt rates
beneath floating glaciers across the northern Greenland coast.</p>
<p>Data from a mooring that I helped to deploy can be found at
