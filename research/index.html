<p>I did my Master&#39;s degree research it the Simon Fraser University <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~gflowers/">Glaciology
Group</a> using sled-mounted radar to map and study
the internal temperature structure of mountain glaciers in Yukon, Canada. We
found the temperature structure to be dominated by processes taking place in the
high-elevation accumulation areas of several glaciers, which becomes imprinted
as the ice flows toward lower elevations. We visualized this process by
reproducing it in simple numerical models recreating glacier flow and heat
transfer.</p>
<p>Some of the software that I used during my research continues to be used in the
form of <a href="irlib.49fold.com">irlib</a>, a Python package for reading and
processing radar files generated by <a href="http://www.radar.bluesystem.ca/">Blue System Integration ice-penetrating
radar</a>.</p>

<p>I studied at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, using oceanographic
measurements from northern Greenland to infer the circulation within an
ice-covered fjord. I then built an automated process to use large quantities of
high-resolution optical satellite imagery to infer melt rates beneath floating
glaciers across the northern Greenland coast.</p>
<p>Data from a moorings that I helped to deploy can be found at
