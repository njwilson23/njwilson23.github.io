*Karta* provides a simple and fast framework for spatial analysis in Python.

The package provides clean vector and raster data types that are geographical
coordinate system-aware, a selection of geographical analysis methods, and the
ability to read and write several formats, including GeoJSON, shapefiles, and
ESRI ASCII.

*Karta* works with Python 2.6-2.7 and Python 3.3+. Suggestions, bug reports,
testcases, and pull requests are welcome, particularly to improve file format
support and test coverage.

See the tutorial_, or read the `API documentation`_.
